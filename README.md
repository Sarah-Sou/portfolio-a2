# ExpressJS Portfolio Website  

Hi, I’m Sarah Soueidan. This is my portfolio project for INFR3120: Web and Script Programming.  
It was built using ExpressJS, EJS, and Bootstrap to create a simple and responsive website with sections for Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

## About the Project  
This project shows how to set up an ExpressJS app with multiple routes and EJS templates.  
It includes a main navigation bar, footer, and a clean layout.  
Each page is rendered through the server, and the design is organized for clarity and easy navigation.
